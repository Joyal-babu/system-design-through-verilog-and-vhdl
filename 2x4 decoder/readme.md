A decoder is a logic circuit that accepts a set of inputs that represents a binary number and activates that output which corresponding to the input binary number.

#  'n' inputs + an enable line and '2^n' outputs
## DECODER DETECTS A PARTICULAR CODE.

One of these outputs will be HIGH based on the combination of the inputs present, when the decoder is enabled. 

Inorder to construct larger memories / decoders from smaller memories / decoders we require decoders with ENABLE signal.
