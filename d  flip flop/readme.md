<h1>D FLIP FLOP</h1>

The D flip-flop is a clocked flip-flop with a single digital input ‘D’. Each time a D flip-flop is clocked, its output follows the state of ‘D’.
A D flip-flop stands for data or delay flip-flop because when the input data is provided into the d flip-flop, the output follows the input data delay by one clock pulse.
