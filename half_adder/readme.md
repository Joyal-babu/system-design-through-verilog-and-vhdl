>TYPES OF VERILOG MODELLING
<h1>1.GATE LEVEL MODELLING</h1>

- Switch/transistor/structural level
- Low level of modelling 
- Complete circuitry of the circuit in terms of logic gates, transistors
- Interconnection of simple components
- Optimized design 
- For complex systems these modelling is difficult

<h1>2.DATAFLOW MODELLING </h1>

- Medium level of modelling 
- We have some details but not GATE level
- Specifies transfer data between the registers
- Some structural information is available (RTL)
- Sometimes similar to behavioural modelling
